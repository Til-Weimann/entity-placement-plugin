# entity-placement-plugin
The Entity Placement Plugin is a tool for Enfusion / ArmA Reforger Tools that allows you to bulk-place entities at specified positions.

It does this by loading coordinates and orientations from a given JSON file - for the correct format, see ept_example.json. It also supports rotation & scale randomization, and includes a terrain snapping feature.
